*那夜王睡不着觉，吩咐人取历史书，就是史籍，念给他听，发现书上写着：王有两个守门的太监辟探和提列，想要下手害亚哈随鲁王，末底改告发了这件事。王说：“末底改做了这事，有没有赐给他什么尊荣或高位呢？”伺候王的臣仆说：“没有赐给他什么。”王说：“谁在院子里？”那时哈曼正进入王宫的外院，要请王把末底改挂在他所预备的木架上。王的臣仆对他说：“看哪，哈曼站在院子里。”王说：“叫他进来。”哈曼就进去。王对他说：“王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，当如何待他呢？”哈曼心里说：“王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，除了我，还有谁呢？”哈曼就对王说：“王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，当把王所穿的王袍拿来，牵了戴冠的御马，把王袍和御马都交给王一个极尊贵的大臣，吩咐人把王袍给王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人穿上，领他骑着御马走遍城里的广场，在他面前宣告：‘王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，就是这样待他。’”王对哈曼说：“你速速把这王袍和御马，照你所说的，向坐在朝门的犹太人末底改去做。凡你所说的，一样都不可缺。”于是哈曼把王袍给末底改穿上，领他骑着御马走遍城里的广场，在他面前宣告：“王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，就是这样待他。”末底改仍回到朝门，哈曼却忧忧闷闷地蒙着头，急忙回家去了。哈曼把所遭遇的一切都说给他妻子细利斯和他所有的朋友听。他的智囊团和他的妻子细利斯对他说：“你在末底改面前开始败落；他既是犹太人，你必不能胜过他，终必在他面前败落。”他们正跟哈曼说话的时候，王的几位太监来了，催哈曼快去赴以斯帖所预备的宴席。(以斯帖记 6:1-14)*

If you ask a random person what special day today is, I’m guessing you might just get a blank stare. I suppose if someone is really informed on things in Africa, they might say it’s Africa Day, celebrating the founding of the African Union. Or if they’re really informed about public awareness holidays, they might say it’s International Missing Children’s Day. But more than likely, even if you’re in the greeting card aisle at the supermarket, you might have to tell your new friend that today is also Ascension Day, and then you might just get a “Huh?” or an “Oh yeah, that too.”

如果你随便问一个人下周有什么特别的日子，我猜你可能只会得到一个茫然的眼神。如果有人真的对各种展览和博物馆感兴趣，他可能会告诉你，下周一是博物馆日；或者如果有人是导游或旅游业的其它工作人员，他也许会告诉你下周二是旅游业。但更可能的是，即使你告诉你的基督徒朋友，下周五是升天日，你可能也只会得到一句“嗯哼”，或，“哦，是，确实是。”

At least in most people’s minds, Ascension Day is not a “date to remember” in Jesus’ list of life events, is it? When compared to Christmas when the divine Son became human, or to the events of Good Friday with his crucifixion to pay the world’s sin, or to Easter, when he showed that death had been defeated by rising bodily from the grave, the ascension seems like a “ho-hum” insignificant event. But it is not! By his ascension, the Son of God showed that he was keeping his promise to go to prepare a place for you in heaven. And Jesus’ ascension also gives clear witness that his role as humble servant is over. He has resumed full use of his divine power and glory as the eternal Son of God.

至少在很多人心里，耶稣升天日并不是耶稣一生的事项中需要记住的日子，不是吗？想想圣诞节，上帝的儿子成为人，或是受难日，他被钉在十字架上为世人的罪付上赎价，或是复活节，借着从坟墓里复活，他显明他胜过了死亡，与这些节日纪念的事件相比，升天似乎更像一个乏味的无聊的事件。但它并不是！借着他的升天，上帝的儿子显明了他对我们的应许：他要去天堂为我们预备地方。耶稣的升天也清楚地见证了他作为卑微的仆人的工作的结束。他能够完全使用他，作为上帝永恒儿子的能力和荣耀。

You see, when Jesus ascended heavenward and the clouds covered him from the view of the disciples, he effectively removed his visible presence from this world. Aside from Paul’s conversion and John’s visions in Revelation, no one has seen Jesus on this earth since that first Ascension Day. But he’s not gone. He promised: And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (Mt 28:20) And Paul reminds us God placed all things under [the ascended Savior’s] feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, (Eph 1:22). Although we can’t see him and we don’t always understand what he allows to happen, Jesus reigns! He rules over all things for our good. That makes Ascension Day a big deal, because it marks the beginning of Jesus doing that. 

当耶稣升天的时候，云彩遮住了他，门徒看不见他了，实际上，他有形的存在从这个世界离开了。除了保罗的归信和约翰在启示录看到的异像外，从耶稣升天日开始，没有人在这个世上看到过耶稣。但是他并没有离开。他应许说：看啊，我天天与你们同在，直到世代的终结（太28:20）。保罗提醒我们说，上帝使万有服在他的脚下，又使他为了教会作万有之首（弗1:22）。尽管我们不能看到他，并且不总是能明白发生了什么。耶稣依然在统治这一切！他为了我们的益处统管万有。这使得升天日成了一件大事，因为这标志着耶稣开始这样做。

What does this have to do with Esther, though? Why Read Esther on Ascension? When you read through the book of Esther, you can’t help but notice that God is never mentioned. It’s really quite surprising, considering that you’re reading the Bible. In the entire book, the name of the LORD is nowhere to be found. But who is the book of Esther really about? Who is really the main character in this account? Esther chapter 6 makes this clear, and by doing so it shows us an important Ascension Day truth. 

这和以斯帖记有什么关系呢？为什么我们要在升天期阅读以斯帖记呢？当你通读以斯帖记时，你会不由自主地注意到，在这卷书里上帝从未被提及。考虑到你读的是圣经，这相当让人惊讶。在整卷书里，耶和华这个名字无处可寻。但以斯帖记真正讲的是谁呢？谁是整个叙事的主角呢？以斯帖记6章清楚地阐明了这一点，它向我们显明了升天日的一个重要真理。

But first a little background. The people of the southern kingdom of Judah, also known as the Jews, were in captivity in Babylon when the Persians took over the empire in 538 BC. Then, about 50,000 Jews returned to Judah two years later, fulfilling Jeremiah’s prophecy that the exile would last 70 years. But the majority of the Jews remained in the land of Persia. About 55 years later, a man whom the Greeks called Xerxes (or you might know him by his Persian name, Ahasuerus) is the king. Xerxes has a high official named Haman, and this official is quite arrogant and wants even more honor and position than he already has as a high government official. One day, he runs into a Jew named Mordecai (who unbeknownst to him was the older cousin of Queen Esther and raised her after her parents died). Mordecai, as a Jew, refuses on principle to bow down before Haman and honor him as if he were a god. So, Haman hatches a plot. 

首先需要介绍一些背景知识。当波斯王在公元前538年征服巴比伦帝国时，南国犹大的居民，也就是犹太人，被囚禁在巴比伦。之后2年，大约5万犹太人回到了犹大地，先知耶利米关于这流亡将持续70年的应许实现了。但大多数犹太人依然留在波斯地。大约55年后，一个叫做亚哈随鲁的希腊人成为了国王。亚哈随鲁有一个叫哈曼的大臣，这个大臣非常傲慢，作为一个高级政府官员，他想要一个更高的尊荣和位置。一天，他遇到了一个叫做末底改的犹太人，他是皇后以斯帖的表哥（尽管哈曼并不知道），在以斯帖的父母死后抚养她长大。作为一个犹太人，末底改拒绝在哈曼面前屈膝，像尊敬上帝一样尊敬他。因此，哈曼恨恶末底改并谋划了一个阴谋。

He wants to exterminate not only Mordecai but also all the other Jews. When his turn comes to meet with Xerxes, he decides to tell the king that a certain people scattered do not obey the king’s laws and taht it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. He whispers winsomely If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will give ten thousand talents of silver [that is, about 375 tons] to the king’s administrators for the royal treasury. And Xerxes trusts his right-hand man. He dismisses the exaggerated offer of money and authorizes the action. Soon letters are sent out to every land in the empire, signed with the king’s name and sealed with the king’s sea：11 months to the day after the decree, all the Jews in the kingdom – young and old, women and children – are to be executed.

他不仅想要消灭末底改，他也想消灭所有犹太人。当轮到他去见亚哈随鲁王时，他告诉王说，有一群散居在王国的民族，不遵守王的律例，容留他们对王一点好处都没有。如果王同意的话，就下一道旨意灭绝他们，我就捐1万他连得（大约375吨）的银子给王的库房。亚哈随鲁王信任他得力的助手。他驳回了这个夸张的捐献，并授权了这个行动。很快，写着王的名字和盖上王的印章的诏书被分发到帝国各地，诏书说，在这诏书颁发的11个月后，这个国家所有犹太人——无论男女老幼——都要被处死。

Mordecai sends word about the decree (and who is behind it) to Esther, telling her that maybe she came into her royal position for just such a time as this. And so, Esther risks her life to approach the king in his royal court even though she was not summoned. Xerxes, instead of ordering her killed for her brazenness (which would have been his right, according to the laws of the Medes and Persians), spares her life, and listens to her request. She asks if the king and Haman would join her that day for a banquet that she had prepared in their honor. They do, and they enjoy the food and the drink set before them, and then Xerxes asks her, what is your request? Esther simply asks that they come to another banquet the following day – then she will answer his question. 

末底改将诏书的事告诉以斯帖，又告诉她说，如今她坐在王后的位置上，或许就是为了这样的时刻。因此，以斯帖在没有国王传唤的情况下，冒着生命危险去内院见国王。亚哈随鲁王并没有因为她的嚣张而杀死她。尽管这是玛代和波斯律法的定例。反倒饶了她的命，并听了她的请求。她请求王和哈曼在那天参加她准备的宴席。他们去了，在宴席喝酒的时候，亚哈随鲁王问她，你想要什么呢？以斯帖只是请求他们第二天接着参加她预备的宴席——然后她会回答他的问题。

Haman leaves the banquet in high spirits. He’s living the high life – just look at his great wealth and his many sons and how the king has honored him above all the other nobles and officials, listening to and trusting his advice. And no one else was invited to dine with the king and queen themselves (not once, but two days in a row) – just him! But then he sees Mordecai on the palace gate and his mood sours. He burns with rage at this disrespectful outsider who still isn’t showing fear in his presence. And then, with the encouragement of his wife and friends at home, he resolves that Mordecai needs to be taken care of, and quickly! No waiting 11 months until the decree comes into effect. He is going to ask the king the very next morning for permission to put Mordecai to death. And he is so sure that his request will be granted that he even makes his servants start building a huge instrument of execution, just so that it is ready immediately once the king agrees. 

哈曼兴高采烈地离开了这宴席。他过着尊贵的生活——只要看看他巨大的财富和他众多的儿女，以及国王是如何高看他超过别的贵族和官员，倾听和相信他的建议。没有其他人被邀请参加国王和王后的私人晚宴，不是一次，而是一连两次——只有他。但是当他看到皇宫门前的末底改时，他的心情就变糟了。他对这个面对他并不害怕的局外人怒火中烧。然后，在他的妻子和朋友的打气下，他决定立刻解决末底改，而不是在11个月后等到法令生效。他要在次日早上请求王将末底改处死。他如此确定他的请求会被准许，以至于他甚至让他的仆人建造一个巨大的刑具，一旦国王同意就可以立刻执行。

It is that very night – a night when the future of God’s people as a whole and of Mordecai specifically is looking very uncertain – that we read about in Esther chapter 6. 

正是在这天晚上，一个上帝子民的未来，尤其是末底改的未来，看起来非常不确定的晚上，这就是我们在以斯帖记6章读到的故事所发生的时间。

It isn’t blind chance that the King Xerxes can’t sleep on that particular night. It isn’t a coincidence that he calls for the history book of his reign. It isn’t happenstance that he happens to open the book to the time when Mordecai exposed the conspiracy of two of Xerxes’ guards who were plotting to assassinate him. It isn’t luck that the king figures out that Mordecai hadn’t been rewarded for this and wants to rectify this oversight. No, in all of this, the hand of God is at work with quiet acts of providence. 

亚哈随鲁王在这个特别的晚上睡不着觉，这并不是歪打正着。他吩咐人拿他统治时期的历史书念给他听，这也并非巧合。他发现书上写着，当王的两个守门的太监密谋杀害他，是末底改告发了这事，这也并不是出于偶然。当王想到末底改没有得到赏赐并想要纠正这一疏忽时，这也不是运气好。不，在所有这一切中，上帝的手都在默默做着他眷顾的工作。

One of the things that the Bible’s teaching of providence shows us is that God’s timing is impeccable. Consider how God guides things here. As soon as Xerxes wants to reward Mordecai’s good citizenship, he asks, Who is in the court [right then in the early morning to advise him on what to do] And guess who has been waiting there exactly then? Haman. He wanted to be there as soon as the king woke up to ask for permission to execute Mordecai. So, the king asks Haman what should be done for the man the king delights to honor? And Haman assumes the king is talking about him – he thinks he is planning his own award ceremony. But God’s plan is quite different. Haman, the king’s most noble prince, is ordered to parade Mordecai through the capital city in the king’s own robe on one the king’s horses with the royal crest on its head and to shout out to all the people to come see this man that Haman hates and how much the king honors him. You can imagine that Haman was choking on every word. 

圣经关于上帝的眷顾的教导，告诉我们，上帝的时间是完美的。想想上帝是如何引导这些事的。当亚哈随鲁王想要奖赏末底改时，他问，谁在院子里。猜一猜谁刚好到那儿呢？哈曼。他想要等王一醒就获得他的准许把末底改杀了。因此，王就问哈曼，王所喜爱要赐尊荣的人，应该怎么办呢？哈曼以为王说的是他——他认为他在规划自己的庆典。但是上帝的计划完全不同。哈曼，这个国王极尊贵的大臣，被命令领着末底改，穿上国王自己的袍子，骑着戴冠的御马，走遍城里的广场，向所有人宣告来看这个人，这个哈曼讨厌而国王又赐他多大尊荣的人。你能够想象哈曼说的每一句话都充满了战抖。

When the parade is over, Haman goes home feeling humiliated and sorry for himself. After he reports what happened, his wife and friends see the writing on the wall and say You will surely come to ruin! They think they are seeing uncontrollable “fate” doing its work, or perhaps their false gods. Although it is the true God working in these things, their premonition turns out to be right. Haman was thinking that things were getting better and better – Queen Esther invited him to not one but two banquets – but things only end up getting worse. The king finds out about his plan to exterminate Mordecai and the Jews, and Xerxes sentences him to die immediately on the very same 75-foot-high instrument of execution Haman had set up so he could kill Mordecai immediately. God’s people in the empire are saved and even blessed through all this. Mordecai gets Haman’s estate, Xerxes permitted the Jews to defend themselves and take the property of anyone who tried to attack them, many people of other nationalities became Jews, and God’s promise to send the Savior through the Jews in Palestine (who were part of that same empire) was still in place for you and me. 

盛大的游行结束后，哈曼带着对自己的羞耻回到家。当他说出发生了什么时，他的妻子和朋友看到了不祥之兆，他们说：你终必会在末底改面前败落！他们认为他们看到了不可控的“命运”，或是他们的假神正在起作用。虽然是真神在掌管这一切，但他们的预感是对的。哈曼认为事情会越来越好——王后以斯帖一次又一次邀请他去赴宴——但结果却越来越糟。随后，国王知道了他灭绝末底改和犹太人的计划，就立即用他计划杀死末底改而设计的刑具处死了他。上帝在波斯帝国的子民得到了拯救，甚至透过这些事蒙了祝福。末底改得到了哈曼的财产，亚哈随鲁王允许犹太人保护他们自己，并拿走任何试图攻击他们的人的财产，很多其它民族的人成为犹太人，上帝为了我们的益处，透过犹太人在巴勒斯坦地区（当时是波斯帝国的一部分）分发福音的应许得以保全。

The book of Esther never mentions God, but it is clear that he is working in the whole thing. In the midst of all these powerful people and sinful schemes and momentous events, he is the one who is in charge. And as we see this, we can only marvel like the Psalmist to hear God teaching us: Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. (Ps 46:10)

以斯帖记从来没有提到上帝，但很明显，上帝在这一切事上做工。在所有这些有位高权重的人，重大的事件甚至是邪恶的计划中间，他是掌管着一切的那一位。当我们看到这些，我们就仿佛听到和诗人一样的教导：你们要休息，要知道我是上帝！我必在列国中受尊崇，在全地也受尊崇（诗46:10）。

And that’s the same thing that Jesus’ ascension teaches us. There is no such thing as coincidence, luck, blind chance or fate. The events of this world are ultimately under the control of Jesus, who rules all things for his church – often in ways unseen. We call this God’s “providence” – which includes his promise to preserve and protect his Church no matter the evil plans and purposes of the devil and of sinful people. That’s why Jesus could tell his disciples concerning his Church: the gates of Hades will not overcome it. (Mt 16:18) The ascended Jesus is the one who makes sure that “God works all things together for good to those who love him, to those who have been called according to his purpose.” (Rom 8:28)

这和耶稣升天教导我们的事情是一样的。并没有什么巧合、运气、机遇或命运。这个世界所发生的一切事都在耶稣的掌控之下，他为教会治理一切的事——通常是以看不见的方式。我们称它为上帝的“眷顾”——这包括他应许保护和保守他的教会，无论魔鬼和罪人有怎样邪恶的计划或目的。这就是为什么耶稣能够告诉他的门徒：阴间的权柄不能胜过教会（太16:18）。升天的上帝保证了“万事都互相效力，叫爱上帝的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人”（罗8:28）。

Jesus’ ascension declares that he is indeed King of kings and Lord of lords. The first Ascension Day was not his retirement day. No, his destination that day was the right hand of the Father; and this is not just a soft sofa in heaven or a cold throne room that Jesus is confined to. It is much more than just a seat of honor. The right hand of God is a state of active dominion and rule on the Father’s behalf. Jesus’ is God’s right hand man, his main manager. 

耶稣升天表明他确实是万王之王、万主之主。第一个升天日并不是耶稣退休的日子。不，在那一天，他的目的地是上帝的右手边；这并不是天堂里某个舒服的沙发或某个冰冷的宫殿，而耶稣被封禁在里面没法出去。这也不只是一个荣耀的座位。上帝的右手边是一个状态，代表天父实行治理和统治。耶稣是天父的助手和他的管家。

Jesus, after he humbled himself to come and win salvation for you, was once again fully exalted and returned to the full and constant use of his divine power for you. And from the Bible we learn many comforting things about Jesus’ ruling. The laws of nature that he created – he actively keeps them working to provide for you – night and day, sunshine and rain, the changing of the seasons. He gives you abilities and the opportunity to use them for work and helping others. He sometimes does miracles and sends his angels to protect you. Although doesn’t always stop a bad thing from happening (for reasons based on his love), he steers events, even sinful ones, to become a blessing for you. 

耶稣降卑他自己，为我们赢得完全的救恩后，再一次完全被高举，回到他的荣耀里，为我们完全并一直使用他神性的能力。关于耶稣的统治，从圣经中我们学到很多令人安慰的事。他创造了自然法则——他让他们为你的益处互相效力——黑夜和白天、阳光和雨水、四季变迁。他给你能力和机会，使用他们去工作并帮助别人。有时，他会行神迹并差派他的天使来保护你。虽然他基于他爱的缘故，并不总是阻止坏事发生，但他掌控一切的事，甚至是恶事，成为对你的祝福。

That’s God’s word for you on Ascension Day and every day. But how easy is it for you to trust that it’s true? Does your sinful nature ever try to make you doubt – maybe in one way some days and in another way other days? 

这就是耶稣在升天节和每一天对你说的话。但你能轻易相信这是真的吗？你的罪性有没有试着让你怀疑呢？你是否会想，也许有时候是这样，有时候却不是这样呢？

Maybe you’re tempted (like Esther no doubt was tempted), to think that there’s nothing you can do to change the world around you and so you just have to sit there fatalistically and take whatever is coming to you or to God’s people. After all, she was hesitant to do anything, because Xerxes hadn’t called her in for 30 days and it was forbidden for her to go to him on her own. But this is a corruption of the teaching of God’s providence – thinking that there is no need for me to plan as hard as I can or pray as passionately as I can or do my best to help and protect the people around me, as if fate has determined everything (even though he tells you that your prayers are effective and your plans and actions let your light shine before others and are ways that he serves them). This kind of fatalism can even go so far as to put the blame on God for our sin and for any of the troubles that we face in this broken world. “God, how could you give me this struggle or sickness or challenge?”  What about you? Do you ever fall into temptation like that? 

也许你会受试探，毋庸置疑，就像以斯帖被试探一样，认为你不能做任何事去改变你周围的世界，所以你只是听天由命地坐在那儿，并对即将临到你或上帝子民的任何事无动于衷。毕竟，以斯帖同样对做任何事犹豫不决，因为亚哈随鲁王已经30天没见她了，并且她自己去见他是不被允许的。但是，认为我并不需要努力地做计划，或热切祷告，或尽我所能去帮助我身边的人，是对上帝眷顾的教导的一种败坏，仿佛命运已经决定了一切事。即使上帝已经告诉你，你的祷告是有效的，你的计划和行动让你的光照在人前，并且是他服事别人的方式。这样的宿命论甚至会将我们的罪，和我们在这个破败的世界面对的麻烦归咎到上帝头上。“上帝啊，你为什么要给我这样的挣扎，疾病或挑战呢？”你是这样吗？你曾经陷入过这样的试探吗？ 

Or on the other side, maybe you’re tempted to ignore God’s providence all together, thinking sometimes (like Haman) that you are in total control and determine everything in your life. In the words of the poet “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.”  Maybe you don’t go so far as to say that Jesus didn’t provide you anything, but you act as if he’s just a clock-maker who made the world and wound it up, but now keeps his hands off, just watching it go around. And you say “look at what I’ve done, all the wealth I’ve earned and all the friends I’ve made and all the honor I’ve gotten from others and all the children I’ve been so great as to raise”  (even though God that says these things are all gifts from him and that he gives you also your abilities and the energy and time to use them). What about you? Do you ever all into temptation like that? 

或者，另一方面，你可能会受试探忽视上帝的眷顾，甚至会像哈曼一样，会认为你完全掌控和决定着你生命中的一切事。正如一首诗说：“我是我命运的主宰，我是我灵魂的统帅。”也是你不会走这么远，你不会说，耶稣没有给你任何东西，但是你的行动仿佛他只是一个钟表匠，他制造了这个世界并给他上了发条，但是现在他的手离开了，只是任凭这个世界这样运转。并且你说：“看看我还需要多少东西啊，我还需要财富、我还需要健康、友谊、婚姻，我还需要别人的尊重和人生的意义，这一切都需要靠着我的手去打拼和争取。”即使上帝说了这些事都是他的恩赐，并且他会按照对你最大的益处供应和眷顾你。你是这样吗？你曾经陷入过这样的试探吗？

If that’s you, brothers and sisters, take heart. Because today on Ascension Day the Jesus whom you see ascending towards the clouds is the same Jesus who lived a life using all his gifts and opportunities and praying and trusting perfectly in your place. The Jesus you see rising through the clouds is the same Jesus who suffered and died to remove the punishment you and I should face for our doubts in his providence. The Jesus you see being taken into heaven is the same Jesus who rose to assure you that you too will live with him with a glorified body forever. 

如果这是你，弟兄姐妹们，现在正是悔改的时刻，现在正是领受他赦免和恩典的时刻。因为耶稣升天了。你所看到的那个升天的耶稣，代替你的位置，用他一切的恩赐、机会、祷告和信心活出了一个完美的一生。你所看到的那个被接到云彩上去的耶稣，借着受苦和死亡，拿走了我们一切罪的惩罚，你所看到的那个被带到天堂的耶稣，向你保证了，你也会和他一起，带着一个荣耀的身体永远活着。

Just like the book of Esther, Jesus’ ascension tells you that your Savior rules from heaven. Jesus – even though you don’t see him visibly and or even hear his name in many parts of your world, works divine providence in every inch of your life. He is the one who guards and strengthens you, both now and to eternity. To him be the glory! Amen. 

正如以斯帖记一样，耶稣升天告诉你，你的救主正在天上统管万事。即使你并不能可见的看到他，在你的世界的很多地方你也听不到他的名，但耶稣依然在你生命中的每个角落保守眷顾你。他是保护坚固你的那一位，从今时直到永远。一切荣耀属于他！阿门！
