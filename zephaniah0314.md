	14 锡安的民哪，应当歌唱！
	以色列啊，应当欢呼！
	耶路撒冷的民哪，应当满心欢喜快乐！

	15 耶和华已经除去你的刑罚，
	赶出你的仇敌。
	以色列的王—耶和华在你中间；

	16 当那日，必有话向耶路撒冷说：
	不要惧怕！锡安哪；
	不要手软！

	17 耶和华—你的　神是施行拯救、
	大有能力的主。
	他在你中间必因你欢欣喜乐，
	默然爱你，且因你喜乐而欢呼。

Today God encourages us to rejoice. But that's not always easy, is it? We face troubles in our personal lives, turmoil and tension in society, problems in the church. When we hear God tell us to be joyful, we might think, “But God, my life is so hard! How can I have joy?” 

今天，上帝激励我们欢喜快乐。但是我们都知道，欢喜快乐并不总是那么容易，是吗？在各自的生活中我们都要面对困难，社会的不安和紧张，家里的、教会里的问题。当我们听到上帝对我们说，要欢喜快乐时，我们可能会想：但是上帝，我的生活如此艰难。我怎么才能快乐起来呢？

If we feel this way, then imagine how Zephaniah’s original audience must have felt. He prophesied during the reign of Josiah, who reigned approximately 640-610 BC. These were not good times for God’s faithful people in Judah. Their entire territory except the capital city, Jerusalem, had been devastated by the Assyrians two generations prior. Ever since that, for the last 60 years the kingdom had been ruled by Manasseh, the most wicked king of all Judah’s history. He tried to regain their political and economic strength by doing whatever the Assyrians suggested. Here is what 2 Kings says about him:

如果我们有这样的感受，那么，请想象一下西番雅所面对的那些最初的听众们，他们会有怎样的感受吧。西番雅作为先知服事的时候正值约西亚作王，约西亚大约在公元前640年至610年的三十年间掌权。对于生活在犹大的上帝忠诚的子民们，这并不是一个好时候。除了首都耶路撒冷外，近百年里，整个犹大疆域早已经被亚述帝国蹂躏、摧毁了。并且，在约西亚作王前，犹大历史上最邪恶的王玛拿西在这片土地上掌权了60年之久。为了再次获得国家政治和经济上的强大，获得眼前的利益，玛拿西愿意做所有亚述人让他做的事情。列忘记下中这样记载说：

“Manasseh did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 3 He rebuilt the high places - pagan worship sites - ; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them... 5 In the two courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts. 6 He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists….  Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the LORD.”

“玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人所行可憎的事。重新建筑他父希西家所毁坏的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，做亚舍拉像，效法以色列王亚哈所行的，且敬拜事奉天上的万象；他在耶和华殿的两院中为天上的万象筑坛，并使他的儿子经火，又观兆，用法术，立交鬼的和行巫术的，不但如此，玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，使犹大人陷在罪里，又流许多无辜人的血，充满了耶路撒冷，从这边直到那边。”

God sent messages through the prophets that because of the wickedness in Manasseh’s reign, he would destroy Jerusalem, and that this decision would not be revoked. 

因为玛拿西统治期间的邪恶，上帝藉着先知告诉以色列人，他要毁灭耶路撒冷，并且这个决定绝对不会更改。

Zephaniah grew up during the reign of Manasseh, but prophesied during the reign of Josiah. Now, in the latter half of Josiah’s reign he rediscovered copies of the Bible, which had been hidden away during Manasseh’s reign, and tried to correct course. He got rid of all the pagan worship sites, and called on the people to worship the true God according to the Bible. But this attempted reform did not take hold. Many of the faithful Israelites had been killed during Manasseh’s reign, and many of the people who were left simply preferred to worship other gods and were very wicked. Josiah’s reforms was too little, too late, to change God’s plan to destroy Jerusalem. 

正是伴随着玛拿西作王掌权，西番雅逐渐地长大成人，并且在约西亚治理犹大的期间，成为神的先知。在约西亚作王的中期，先知西番雅发现了在玛拿西作王时被藏起来的圣经的抄本，使神的话语重见天日。西番雅试图找到正确的方向。他清除了所有异教的邱坛，他呼召人们来按着圣经的话敬拜唯一的真神上帝。但是这个回归的尝试没有实现。在玛拿西掌权的时候，太多敬虔的以色列人都被杀害了，并且那些得以幸存的人们，他们只是选择去敬拜其他的神，变得非常的软弱、罪恶。约西亚所带来的变化太微不足道了，或者说想要改变上帝摧毁耶路撒冷的计划，已经太晚了。

We can tell this in part because of Zephaniah’s message in this short book of only three chapters.  His book primarily describes God’s coming judgment and punishment: “I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host.

我们可以象局外人一样更深刻地看待这段历史，是因为西番雅在西番雅书短短地三章经文中讲述了这样的信息。他的书最重要的是将上帝将要带来的审判和惩罚的信息清晰地描绘出来：“我必伸手攻击犹大和耶路撒冷的一切居民，也必从这地方剪除所剩下的巴力，并基玛琳的名的和祭司，与那些在房顶上敬拜天上万象的。”

Zephaniah sees the destruction of Jerusalem, and blends his description of that destruction with the final destruction that will take place on the day of the Lord: “I will bring such distress on all people , that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung. 

西番雅看到耶路撒冷的毁灭，他所看到的毁灭的画面，和主再来的日子将要发生的最终极的毁灭联系在一起。那最终的毁灭是这样的：我必使灾祸临到人身上，使他们行走如同瞎眼的，因为得罪了我。他们的血必倒出如灰尘；他们的肉必抛弃如粪土。

But Zephaniah called the people to repent: Gather together... you shameful nation,… before the LORD’s fierce anger comes upon you... 3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD’s anger. 

但是，先知西番雅向人们呼喊着，叫他们悔改，他说：不知羞耻的国民哪，你们应当聚集！趁命令没有发出，他发怒的日子未到以先，你们应当聚集起来；世上遵守耶和华典章的谦卑人哪，你们都当寻求耶和华；当寻求公义谦卑，或者在耶和华发怒的日子，可以隐藏起来。

So what was their hope? The day of the Lord’s anger was coming and could not be stopped. But perhaps, on that day, they would be sheltered. Towards the end of the book, Zephaniah explains how this will happen: On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. 12 But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD. 

那么，他们的盼望是什么呢？主要发烈怒的日子就要到了，并且已经无法阻止。但是，在那天，他们或许可以被隐藏起来。直到西番雅书的结尾，先知解释了如何可以隐藏起来：当那日，你，耶路撒冷，必不因你一切得罪我的事，自觉羞愧；因为那时我必从你们中间除掉矜夸高傲之辈，我却要在你中间，留下困苦贫寒的民，他们必投靠我耶和华的名。

God would purify his people in Jerusalem by removing all the proud and arrogant unbelievers from her midst. The meek, the humble, those who trusted in God would be spared. 

上帝将会在耶路撒冷洁净他的子民，他要将所有狂傲不信的人，从耶路撒冷剪除。而那困苦贫寒的，那些依靠上帝的人将得以存留。

Would that be an easy environment for you to find joy? Here you were, living as part of God’s chosen nation, and most of the people around you had abandoned the true God to such an extent that they were persecuting true believers and worshipping many other gods. They ignored all the warnings of the prophets, and you knew, without a doubt, that God would soon destroy the city because of their callous, wicked behavior. You had a godly king trying to reform, but most people didn’t care. Because of their wickedness, you, or perhaps your children or grandchildren, would not be able to escape going into exile and seeing your city destroyed.

对于你来说，在这样的环境中找到喜乐，快乐会很容易吗？假如这是你，你作为上帝所拣选的国度的一员，生活其中；而你周围大多数的人，他们已经离弃了真正的上帝，他们离弃神到了一个程度，以致开始逼迫真正的信徒，并且开始敬拜所有其他的假神。他们忽视所有先知发出的警告，并且你早就知道，毫不怀疑，上帝会很快地，因为他们的麻木，因为他们邪恶的行为而毁掉这个城市。你有一个敬虔的国王，他尝试着改变这种状况，但是大多数的人根本不在乎。因为他们的邪恶，你，或者你的孩子和子孙后代，不可避免地要被流放到异国他乡，并且要亲眼看着你的城市毁灭。

Do you think they might have been bitter? Perhaps tempted to lose hope?  But then Zephaniah leads them in this wonderful song of praise that is our reading for today. The reason for reviewing all this background about Zephaniah is to realize what a terrible situation he was living in. This wonderful song of joy is not due to Zephaniah’s good mood. He is not simply being optimistic. He knew that destruction would come. If that was all he knew, he would have been one depressed prophet. But he saw beyond that, to God’s goodness to his people, and the future great things he would do. When he thought about that, it brought joy. 

你觉得他们会感受到痛苦吗？或者会身不由己地失去希望吗？但是西番雅却带着他们，用这首美妙的诗歌，就是我们今天读到的经文，高声唱着赞美。之所以我们要回顾西番雅所处时期真实状况，原因就是因此可以让我们意识到，他生活在糟糕至极的环境中。这美妙的充满喜乐的歌声，不能归因于西番雅还不错的情绪控制。他不仅仅是保持乐观。他知道毁灭和破坏是必然会来临的。如果这是他所知道的一切，他就只能是一个一蹶不振的，抑郁的先知。但是他可以看到更远的未来，他可以越过这毁灭的画面看得更远，看到上帝对他子民美好的旨意，看到神将要在未来所做的伟大的事情。当他想到这些时，他感到无比的喜乐。

The song is addressed to Zion, another name for Jerusalem. Because God’s people were to come to Jerusalem and worship him together in the temple there, “Zion” and “Jerusalem” is a way of referring to all those who worshipped him, all his faithful people. 

这诗歌是关于锡安的，耶路撒冷的另一个名字。因为上帝的子民总是来到耶路撒冷，在那里的圣殿中，一起敬拜他，锡安和耶路撒冷这两个名字，是称呼所有敬拜神的人，所有他忠实的子民的一个方式。

Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! This is a deep, inner joy, but it is real and complete enough that it cannot help but be manifest in outward expressions. What would possibly make the people so glad? 

锡安的民哪，应当歌唱！以色列啊，应当欢呼！耶路撒冷的的民哪，应当满心欢喜快乐。

这是从内心深处发出的喜乐，又是真实、完满的喜乐，是不能自已的，溢于言表的喜乐。是什么事让这些子民如此的快乐呢？

15 The LORD has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. This punishment he refers to is not the destruction of Jerusalem, that could not be avoided. He was talking about something bigger something that went back to the garden of Eden, when he promised to crush the serpents head, and put enmity back where it belonged. Because even though believers in those days lived in some pretty difficult times, the biggest enemy they faced wasn’t other people. It was that they were sinful people who deserved God’s punishment. God promised that the punishment they deserved would be taken away. Their enemy was Satan and the evil, idolatrous behavior he inspired all around them, and still inspires today. Yet, God promised he would overcome their enemies that. 

耶和华已经除去你的刑罚，赶出你的仇敌。

这里先知所提及的惩罚，指的并不是耶路撒冷的毁灭，耶路撒冷一定会被夷为平地。先知说的是一件更大的事情，一件可以追溯到伊甸园，当上帝承诺要伤蛇的头，关于消除仇恨的事情。因为即使在那个时代里，生活在极其艰难的日子里的信徒们，他们所面对的最大的敌人从来都不是其他人。他们自己是有罪的人，只配得到上帝公义的惩罚。上帝承诺他们本该受的一切的惩罚，将会被拿走。他们的敌人是撒旦，是魔鬼；魔鬼所怂恿的拜偶像拜假神的行为围绕者他们，今天也是如此。然而，上帝承诺说，他将要胜过他们的仇敌。

It wouldn’t happen in their lifetimes, and they probably realized that. But they knew about the baby born of a virgin in Isaiah, born in Bethlehem according to Micah, who would grow up to be the suffering servant, who like a sacrificial lamb would bear the sin of God's people, suffer death at the hands of sinners, and again see life. And even in the midst of their pain and suffering, they could rejoice, and rejoice greatly, because through him God would remove their sin and its punishment. 

这不会发生在西番雅时期民众活着的时代，并且人们很可能意识到了这点。但是他们知道以赛亚书中提到童贞女怀孕生子，他们知道弥迦书里提到的，这孩子将要降生在伯利恒，他将会慢慢长大，成为一位忍受苦难的仆人，他将会像一个待宰的羊羔，担当上帝之民的罪孽，他们知道这人会在罪人的手中忍受死亡，并且复活。并且，即使当他们仍旧忍受着痛苦和苦难时，他们仍然能够欢喜快乐，并且极大地欢喜，极大地快乐，因为藉着这个将要出生的孩子，上帝要拿走他们的罪和惩罚。

The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm.

And because of this future act of forgiveness, they knew God was with them in this dark time. He was in the midst of this people because his Word was still there, and his promises were still there. Whatever lay in store for them, he would protect them and watch over them. As Jesus put it, the God of Abraham is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Even if he allowed their lives to be taken, if he allowed them to be martyred by unfaithful Judean leaders, or killed by Babylonian arrows, they could confess with David that even in death, I am with you. If I go down to the grave, there God is with me. At last they knew they would be in his presence, and it would give them joy. 

以色列的王在你中间，你必不再惧怕灾祸。

正是因为这未来赦免的作为，他们知道即使在最黑暗的时刻，上帝仍旧与他们同在。因为上帝的话语仍旧在他们中间，他就在他们中间。无论有什么等着他们，上帝都将保护他们，为他们守望。就像耶稣说的，亚伯拉罕的神不是死人的神，而是活人的神。即使上帝允许他们的生命被拿走，即使上帝允许他们被不敬虔的犹大领袖们杀害，或死在巴比伦的刀剑之下，即使在死亡面前他们任然可以和大卫一起宣告：我和神在一起。我若下到坟墓里，神仍然在我身边。最后，他们知道自己总会有他的同在，这让他们感到无比的快乐。

In the final part of the song, they are encouraged to look forward to the day when God himself would come to his people. For them, just knowing about the great things God would do, that we have seen and now experience, was enough to rejoice.

在赞美诗歌的最后部分，先知鼓励人们，殷切地渴望上帝自己要来到他子民中间的日子。对于他们而言，只是知道上帝将要做奇妙伟大的事情，这就足以让他们欢喜快乐了；而这事情我们已经看见，现在又经历着。

On that day     they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion;     do not let your hands hang limp. 17 The Lord your God is with you,     the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you;     in his love he will no longer rebuke you,     but will rejoice over you with singing.”

当那日，必有话向耶路撒冷说，“不要惧怕！锡安哪，不要手软！耶和华你的神是施行拯救，大有能力的主！他在你中间必因你欢欣喜乐，默然爱你，且因你喜乐而欢呼。”

Like a mighty warrior, God would arrive and save them from their sin, from death, from the wickedness and idolatry of the world. He would take great delight in them, and God’s people would be renewed and restored, filled with excitement, and joy, as they delighted in the God who delighted in them. 

就像是一个大能的勇士一样，上帝会如约而至，并将他们从罪、死亡和邪恶充满偶像崇拜的世界中拯救出来。他会在他们中间带来极大的喜乐，并且上帝的子民将要被更新和恢复，将要在那喜悦他们的上帝里，享受这份异常的兴奋，欢喜快乐。

How did this message work out for Zephaniah? Would we call him a success? Maybe. There was a small revival in Josiah’s day. The faithful believers were able to come out of the woodwork, as it were, and the idolaters had to go into hiding. The temple was once again opened to the worship of the true God, the Passover was celebrated, and God was glorified. But it didn’t take root. When Josiah died, his descendants did not follow the Lord with all their hearts, most of the people continued with their idolatry in secret, and the nation was still destroyed. But some people remained faithful in exile, and eventually returned to rebuild Jerusalem and prepare the way for Jesus. So it depends how long a timeframe you're looking at. They were just one small link in the chain that stretches from Adam to eternity – and by the way, so are we. 

这样的信息为西番雅带来怎样的结果呢？或者，我们可以说他成功了吗？或许是这样，这确实为约书亚的时代带来了一次小小的兴奋。忠诚的信徒们可以远离曾经围绕着自己的偶像，而那拜偶像的人们也要因这异常的喜乐而躲藏起来。圣殿再次敞开大门，为要敬拜那真正的上帝，人们欢庆度过逾越节，将荣耀归给上帝。

但这并不是结局。当约西亚死后，他的后代们不再用心跟随上帝，大多数人继续偷偷地敬拜假神和各种偶像，并且这个国家终于有一天难逃毁灭的厄运。但是，一些人仍旧可以在流放的日子里忠心耿耿，并且最终他们可以回到耶路撒冷，再建这座城市，并且为耶稣的到来预备一切。

取决于你所选取的时间段的长短，去看待他们的故事。从亚当到永恒之间，西番雅、约西亚和那个时代的人们，只是这漫长岁月里的一环；我们的故事也是如此。 

But Zephaniah’s message did bring joy in his day and in the centuries to follow. Not because it fixed all the problems of the society around them. It didn’t stop wicked people from being wicked. But this message lifted them up to a higher plane. They could see where the suffering, tragedy, and sense of futility they experienced fit in to God’s bigger picture. What matters in the end is not having the greatest experience we can in this life. It’s not even seeing the biggest possible success. What matters is having God on our side, and knowing in the end his plans cannot be stopped. What matters is knowing our sins do not separate us from him. Knowing God’s forgiveness and victory in Christ raises us above our problems and pain, and puts them into perspective. Instead of making us miserable, our suffering increases our joy, because it makes us look forward all the more to the day in the future when God will make all things right.  

但是西番雅的信息真地为他的时代和后来数个世纪，带去了喜乐。这不是因为围绕人们的所有的社会问题被解决了。不是因为使那些邪恶的人不再做恶毒的事情。事实是，这个信息将他们带到更广阔的天空。他们可以看到自己所经历的苦难、悲剧、徒劳无益的事情，都一一归到上帝那副巨大而美好的图画中。

在最后的时刻，最重要的不是我们可以在今生有多么伟大的经历，甚至也不是我们可以看到最大的成就。最重要的是，有神在我们一边，并且知道在最后的时刻，他的计划没有人可以阻止。最重要的是，知道我们的罪不能让我们与上帝分开了，知道上帝在基督里的赦免和胜利，将我们从我们的问题和痛苦中高高举起，使我们的眼界超越它们，看得更远。因此，我们的苦难不再使我们绝望，而是让我们感受到加倍的快乐，因为这些我们所经历的痛苦，让我们更加盼望着，满心期待着未来上帝可以使一切都美好的日子的到来。

What part of living in this sinful world have been stealing your joy lately? When our lives do not reflect joy, it reflects sinful doubt in God, and prideful assurance that we know better than he does what we really need and deserve. Our nasty little comments, our complaining and groaning, our refusal or inability to enjoy the many blessings in life, and instead insist on being upset because this day didn’t go just the way I wanted it to, or this person didn’t treat me just how I deserved, shows a mind more concerning with earthly things than heavenly things, and it shows what we deserve is God’s wrath. 

最近，生活在这个罪恶世界中的那个事情，偷走了你的喜乐吗？当我们的生命不是展示出喜乐时，它所显现出来的一定是在罪中对上帝的怀疑，并且骄傲地确信，我们比神更知道我们自己真的需要什么，想要什么。我们气急败坏的嘀咕，我们的抱怨和唉声叹气，我们拒绝或无法享受生命中诸多的祝福，取而代之的是，顽固地待在气急败坏里，只因为今天没有一件事情按着我希望的样子发生，或者这个人没有按着我本该得到的对待我，每件事情都暴露了只关心世界上的事，而不关心天上事情的想法，这都表明，我们所配得到的，只是上帝的烈怒。

Yet, are your trials and difficulties worse than the situation in Josiah’s day? Surely not. And it’s not only that living standards, life expectancy, and technology have improved. The greatest advantage we have over them is that we have seen fulfilled so much of what they looked forward to. We have seen how God came as a warrior to save us. We have seen that baby, who did battle with the devil through his perfect life, who did battle with death by dying on the cross, and who emerged victorious at the resurrection. All those promises they longed to see fulfilled, we celebrate every year in church and every day in our lives. 

然而，你所经历的考验和困难，比约西亚时代的环境更恶劣吗？当然没有。不仅仅我们的生活标准，对生活的期待，科技、医疗和健康水平比他们更好。相比他们，我们所拥有的最大的优势是，我们已经看到他们一生所盼望，所期待的事情已经一丝不差地实现了。我们看到了上帝如何像一个勇士一样来救我们。我们看到了那个婴孩儿，我们看到他用自己完美的生命与魔鬼征战，我们看到他用自己在十字架上的死亡，与死亡征战；我们看到他在复活中所展现的胜利。所有这些他们渴望看到的应许都实现了，我们每一年都会在教会里、每一天都在我们的生命里庆祝这个胜利。

And as much as God was with his people of then, since Pentecost he has been with his New Testament people in a more powerful way. In the Old Testament, God’s people had enough trouble simply staying faithful and avoiding idol worship. Their nation was supposed to be a light to the nations, but that proved difficult when most of them were completely unfaithful. But today, God promise has come true and the mission to the world is underway. Because we have seen Jesus, because we are filled with God’s spirit, our hands cannot remain limp by our sides. We cannot sit around, worrying about this, afraid of that.  God has empowered us. Each one of us has the Spirit, and each one of us has spiritual gifts. Those gifts were no given for us to have slack hands, hanging by our sides. Those gifts are given so that we can do God’s work, building up God’s church, encouraging God’s people, bringing others into God’s family. 

他们的国本应是万国的光，但是当他们中的大多数人彻底的不忠时，发出光芒变得异常艰难。但是今天，上帝的应许已经实现，并且他给世界的使命已经出发。因为我们已经看到了耶稣，因为我们充满着上帝的灵，我们的手不愿意就垂在身体的两侧。我们不愿冷眼旁观，担心这个，害怕那个。上帝已经给了我们力量，给了我们能力，给了我们胜利。我们中的每一个人都拥有他的圣灵，我们中的每个人都有上帝给我们的恩赐，服事的恩赐。这些恩赐给了我们，不是为了让我们将他们束之高阁。这些恩赐给我们，是为了我们可以去做上帝的工作，建造上帝的教会，鼓励上帝的子民，邀请更多失丧的家人回到上帝的家里。

There’s nothing that makes God happier than seeing you, each one of you, as you trust in him, and as you use the gifts he has given you to his glory. As he looks down on us, as Zephaniah says, he takes great delight in us. And even though he is the one who deserves our praise, Zephaniah says that God rejoices over us with singing. And knowing that he rejoices in us as we trust and serve him makes as all the more joyful in him. 

没有什么事情，比看到你，看到你们每个人，看到你们相信他，信靠他，更让上帝感到高兴了。尤其当你使用他为了他自己的荣耀，早已经给你的恩赐、天赋时，他更是感到无比的欣慰。当他低头看着我们时，就像先知西番雅所说的，他因为我们而欢喜快乐。并且，即使他是那位配得我们赞美的，西番雅说，神且因我们喜乐而欢呼歌唱。知道当我们信靠他，服事他的时候，他因我们而如此的快乐，这就让我们更加地因他而欢喜快乐。

What was that situation in life that makes it hard for you to have joy? When you face it this week, do not fear. Rejoice and sing with all your heart, for your Lord Jesus has come to save you, and will come again save you from that last day of destruction. Do not let your hands hang limp, for your Lord Jesus is with you. He takes great delight in you and rejoices over you with singing. Amen.

你生命中那些情况会拦阻你拥有喜乐呢？当你这个星期面对这拦阻的时候，不要惧怕！用你的全身心去欢呼和歌唱，因为你的主耶稣已经来救你了，并且他会在毁灭这个世界的日子再此来救你。不要让你的受如此沉重地垂着，因为你的主耶稣基督和你同在。他因你感到极大的喜乐，并且因你喜乐而欢呼歌唱。阿们。
