*从此，他门徒中有很多退却了，不再和他同行。耶稣就对那十二使徒说：“你们也要离开吗？”西门‧彼得回答他：“主啊，你有永生之道，我们还跟从谁呢？我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。”(约翰福音6:66-69)*

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

奉主耶稣基督的名。阿门！

“Do you want to go away as well?” Thus with sad countenance Christ in John 6 spoke to the Twelve, when many other disciples had just left Him. This is the same question which I feel I must impress upon you, my dear children!

“你们也要离开吗？”在约翰福音6章，耶稣带着悲哀的面容对他的十二个门徒说这话，那时，很多其他的门徒已经离开了。亲爱的弟兄姐妹，这是同样的一个，我认为我必须摆在你们面前的一个问题。

You have declared that today you are prepared to swear eternal faithfulness to your Savior. Alas, many a child has kneeled at this altar, wet it with his tears, and with trembling voice said: “Yes, I will remain with Jesus, with His Word, with His grace, with His Church; nothing, neither pain nor joy, neither honor nor dishonor, neither poverty nor riches, neither life nor death, shall separate me from Him.” But before the next Palm Sunday had rolled around he had already left his Savior. With deep melancholy I today think of so many confirmands on whose head I laid my hand of blessing. They were the joy of my heart; like green trees they had grown up in the garden of the Lord. With joyous hopes I took leave of them. I thought, if no one remains faithful, these anyhow will. I had often seen tears tremble in their eyes and roll over their cheeks! But what has happened? Where are they now? The fire of faith and love that was kindled in them is extinguished. They are now cold and dead. They have left Christ and loved the world as Demas did.

你们已经宣告说，你们预备好了要永远忠实于你们的救主。诶，很多人曾经跪在祭坛前，泪流满面，带着战抖的话说：“是的，我将一直和耶稣，和他的圣道，他的恩典，他的教会在一起；没有任何事情，无论是痛苦还是喜乐、荣耀还是羞耻、贫穷还是富有、生命还是死亡，都不能让我和他分开。”但是在明年的这个时候，他已经离开了他的救主。今天，我满怀惆怅地想到那么多我按手祝福的人。他们曾经是我心里的喜乐；他们曾经像青翠的树，被栽种在上帝的花园里。我曾带着喜乐的盼望注视着他们。我曾想，如果没有人保持忠信，无论如何，这些人总会。我曾常常看到他们的眼泪在眼眶里打转！但是后来发生了什么呢？他们现在在哪儿呢？那在他们心里燃气的信心和爱的火，被熄灭了。他们现在冰冷而死寂。他们如同底马一样，贪爱这个世界并离开了基督。

I must confess that the thought of these unfortunate children has so depressed my heart that it wants to turn today’s joy into a day of sorrow and grief. However, I find in the Gospel of John that the Savior experienced the same thing. What did He do? Sadly He looked at those who were leaving Him, but He did not give up the others who were still with Him. Trustingly, He turned to His faithful Twelve with the question, “Do you want to go away as well?” And what did they answer? Peter quickly spoke up. Deeply shaken, zealously he cried, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that You are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69).

我必须承认，想到这些不幸的人，在我的心里充满了沮丧，它甚至想要将这个喜乐的一天变为悲痛和哀伤的一天。然而，在约翰福音中我看到救主经历了同样的事情。他做了什么呢？他悲哀的看着那些离开他的人，但是他并没有放弃其他的依然和他在一起的人。他满怀信赖的问他的十二个门徒这样一个问题：“你们也要离开吗？”他们是怎么回答他的呢？彼得很快地说：“主啊，你有永生之道，我们还跟从谁呢？我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。”

Now if Jesus were to step visibly before us, what question do you suppose He would ask you? Certainly, He would also ask you: Children, “do you want to go away as well”? And what would you answer Him? Would you say: “My dear Savior, we can no longer remain with You. The world is too enticing, sin is too sweet, Your yoke is too hard, and Your burden too heavy!”? Oh, never! Never! I do not doubt that with all your heart you would as one voice loudly repeat Peter’s word.

现在，如果耶稣可见地站在你的面前，你认为他会问你什么问题呢？当然，他同样会问你：“孩子，你也要离开吗？”你会怎么回答他呢？你会说：“我亲爱的主啊，我不能在跟随你了。这个世界太诱人了，罪太甜蜜了，你的轭太难，而你的担子太重了！”你会这样回答他吗？哦，决不！决不！我毫不怀疑你们都会一心一意异口同声的重复彼得的话。

So let us pause a few moments while I present to you:

Your Answer to Christ’s Question: “Do you want to go away as well?”

It is this:

1. “Lord, to whom shall we go?” and,

2. “You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that You are the Holy One of God.”

所以让我们来思考，对于这个问题，彼得的回答，这同样是你们的回答。这个回答包括两部分。

1、	我们还跟从谁呢？

2、	你有永生之道，我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。

I.

“Lord, to whom shall we go?” With this new question Peter answered Christ’s question, “Do you want to go away as well?” Peter wanted to say: “Lord, can You really ask us that? Is it possible that we would be so unthankful as to forget Your love, erase these benefits that we have enjoyed with You from our hearts and minds, and forsake You? Where should we then go? Whither shall we turn? Where would we seek the light of truth that we need?” How shall we appease the hunger and thirst of our souls for God’s grace and peace? How shall we gratify our yearning for happiness? Where shall we seek comfort in affliction, solace for the misery of sin, deliverance from death, and eternal life? We would look around in the whole creation in vain. We know of no person in the world, no creature in heaven and on earth, to whom we can go and find what we seek.

“主啊，我们还能跟从谁呢？”彼得用这个新的问题，回答了基督的问题：“你们也要离开吗？”彼得想要说：“主啊，你真的可以这样问我们吗？难道我们会如此的忘恩负义，忘记你的爱，抹去我们和你在一起的一切好处，并抛弃你吗？如果真的会这样，那么，我们应该去哪儿呢？我们应该转向何方呢？我们还可以在哪儿寻找我们需要的真理之光呢？”我们怎么才能平息我们心灵对上帝的恩慈和平安，永不止息的渴望呢？我们怎么来能填满我们对快乐的渴望呢？我们要在哪里去寻找痛苦中的舒缓，罪的不幸中的慰藉，从死亡中得释放，以及永生呢？我们将会在整个宇宙中徒劳的寻找。我们知道在这世上没有人，在天上地下没有别的受造物，我们可以跟随并找到我们所寻求的。

Peter and all the apostles did not know where they should go if they should leave Christ. Do you perhaps know?

彼得和所有使徒都不知道，如果他们离开基督，他们可以往哪儿去。你知道吗？

It is true that all those who left Christ thought they could find happiness elsewhere. One left Christ and sought happiness in striving after money and other earthly goods; another left Christ and sought happiness in all manner of lusts and desires; another left Christ and sought happiness in the favor and friendship of the world; another left Christ and sought happiness in honor and respect among men; another left Christ and sought happiness in the search after the wisdom of this world. Did they find what they looked for? Alas, no! Either they returned to Christ as soon as they recognized that they were deceived, or they had to confess in the very hour of their death that their search was in vain, that their heart had deceived them.

的确，所有离开基督的人，都认为他们可以在别的地方找到快乐。有人离开基督，在努力追逐金钱和别的属世财货中寻求快乐；有人离开基督，在形形色色的情欲和放荡中寻求快乐；有人离开基督，在世人的欢心和友谊中寻求快乐；有人离开基督，在尊荣和人们的尊敬中寻求快乐；有人离开基督，在追逐这个世界的智慧中寻求快乐。他们找到了他们所寻求的吗？诶，不！他们要么意识到他们被欺骗了，并立刻回到耶稣那儿，要么，他们不得不在临终的那一刻，承认他们的寻找都不过是徒劳，他们的心欺骗了他们。

Judas left Christ in order to win earthly treasure. Yes, he betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver. But that money soon became like fire in his hands and heart; he despaired and come to a terrible end. Similarly everyone enjoys his earthly goods that he seeks and for which sake he leaves Christ just as little.

犹大为了赚得这世上的钱财离开基督。是的，他为了30个银钱出卖了基督。但是这个钱在他手里很快变得像炭火一样；他绝望了，走向了一个可怕的结局。同样，每一个喜悦于他属世的财货，并为此离开基督的人，也是如此。

David once left his God and Savior and fell into the sin of lust; alas! as sweet as it once was, just so bitter it soon became. Hear how he complained and lamented in his psalm of penitence. The lust of sin became arrows that pierced his heart and conscience, a heavy load that like a mountain pressed him to the ground! He did not buy his happiness with the lust of sin, but he sold it. At night he watered his bed with his tears; during the day he went about with fallen countenance, bent and bowed and sad. His previous blessed peace, the sweet rest of his soul, was gone.

大卫有一次离开他的神和救主，并陷入了情欲的罪中；诶！它曾经有多么的甜蜜，它就很快变得有多么的痛苦。听听在他忏悔的诗篇中他是如何哭诉和哀悼的吧。罪恶的情欲变成了刺入他心里的箭，沉重的负担像一座山一样压在他身上！他并没有用这样罪恶的情欲买来他的快乐，他卖了这快乐。在深夜他用眼泪浇灌他的床榻；在白天他带着愁苦的表情走来走去，难过压垮了他的腰。他之前蒙福的平安和心灵甜蜜的安息，都不在了。

Solomon left his God and Savior, loved the world, and enjoyed all his pleasures; but scarcely had he enjoyed them when he cried out, “I said in my heart, ‘Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.’ But behold, this also was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:1). “Sorrow is better than laughter” (7:3).

所罗门离开了他的上帝和救主，贪爱这个世界，享受一切的喜乐；但是当他享受到它们之后，他就立刻呼喊道：“我心里说：‘来吧，让我用喜乐试试你，使你享福！’看哪，这也是虚空。”“忧愁强如喜笑。”

Peter himself left his Savior for a short time despite his promise, just to get the favor and friendship of the world and save his life; alas! he soon experienced that he had only made himself inexpressibly unhappy; he quickly left the company of the world and wept bitterly.

彼得自己也曾不顾自己的承诺，短暂的离开他的救主，只是为了得到世人的欢心和友谊；诶！他马上就意识到，他只不过是让自己陷入了无法表达的不快中；他很快就离开人群，出去痛哭。

A well-known German king at the time of the Reformation left Christ in order to be and remain the mightiest and greatest of men; but after he had enjoyed all the honor and glory of the world, he confessed that his crown with its earthly honor was only a burden. He laid his crown and scepter aside. In repose in Christ he sought that peace and happiness, which he had not been able to find in the whole world.

在宗教改革时期，一个著名的德国国王，为了成为最有权势和最伟大的人，离开了基督；但是在他获得了这个世界一切的荣耀和尊崇后，他承认他头上带着属世的荣耀的王冠不过是一个重担。他放下他的王冠和权杖。在基督里面找到了他的平安和快乐，这是在全世界他都不能找到的。

Paul, while still named Saul, left the Savior, who had been preached by the prophets and rejected the Gospel. He sought rest in the wisdom of this world but did not find it; finally, he turned to Christ and he not only confessed, “In [Christ] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:3); but he also added, “To know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge” (Ephesians 3:19). (German: To love Christ is better than all knowledge).

保罗，当他还是扫罗的时候，离开了先知所传讲的救主，拒绝了福音。他在这世界的智慧中寻求安息，却并没有找到；最后，他转向基督，他不仅承认：“在他里面蕴藏着一切智慧和知识。”并且他也说：“并知道这爱是超过人的知识所能测度的”。

Oh my dear children, you see that without exception all who had left Christ and had sought happiness elsewhere had to confess that they had deceived themselves. So tell me, what will you do? What will you answer the Savior who so lovingly asks you: Children, “do you want to go away as well?” Is it not true that today all of you will answer, “Lord Jesus, how can we leave You who loved us from eternity, redeemed us in time, bought us with Your blood, and baptized us? From the time of our birth You have carried us in Your arms and guided us with Your gracious hands. We cannot even express how much You have done for us! But can we be so unthankful as to forget Your eternal faithfulness and mercy toward us? Lord Jesus, if we wanted to leave You, to whom shall we go? If You cannot make us happy here and save us hereafter, who can? If we do not find in You that after which our souls thirst, where shall we find it?”

亲爱的弟兄姐妹，你看到，所有离开基督去别处寻求快乐的人，没有一个例外，都不得不承认他们欺骗了他们自己。所以告诉我，你将会做什么？当救主如此亲切的问你，“你也要离开吗？”你将会回答什么？今天，我们岂不都会回答说：“主耶稣啊，我们怎么能离开你呢？你从永恒中爱了我们，在一个特定的时间救赎我们，用你的血赎买了我们，并洗净了我们。当我们在母腹中，你就用你的臂膀环绕我们，用你恩慈的手指引我们。我们甚至无法表达你为我们做了多少事！但是我们怎能如此的忘恩负义，忘掉你对我们永恒的信实和怜悯？主耶稣啊，倘若我们想要离开你，我们还能跟从谁呢？如果你不能让我们在今生有喜乐，并在来生拯救我们，还有谁能呢？如果我们不能在你里面找到我们心灵所渴望的，我们还能在哪里找到呢？”

If we wanted to go and grab after gold and treasures, what would we gain? What would it profit us if we would gain the whole world and still lose our souls? We would still be eternally poor. Or, if we wanted to go and plunge into the lusts and sins and pleasures of the world, what would it profit us? Our hearts would here remain without peace and hereafter we would have to languish eternally. Or, if we wanted to go and seek the favor and friendship of the world, what would it profit us, even if the whole world were our friend but the almighty God our enemy? Or, if we wanted to go and seek honor and respect among men, what would it profit us, even if here we could boast of the greatest honor? Hurled from our heights, we would in eternity stand ashamed before God and His angels. Or finally, if we wanted to leave You and seek the wisdom of this world, what would it profit us? What would all light for this life profit us without that Light which shows us the way to heaven? Behold, Lord, where should we go if we wanted to leave You? We do not know.

如果我们想要追逐和抓住黄金和珍宝，我们会赢得什么呢？如果我们赢得了全世界但却失去了我们的灵魂，我们会获得什么益处呢？我们将会陷入永恒的贫穷中。或者，如果我们想要追逐和收获这个世界的情欲、罪和愉悦，这对我们有什么益处呢？我们将在今生不得安宁，并在来生陷入永恒的枯萎中。或者，如果我们想要寻求这个世界的钟爱和友谊，即使全世界都是我们的朋友而全能的上帝是我们的敌人，这对我们又有什么益处呢？或者，如果我们想要追逐和寻求荣耀和人们的重视，即便在今生我们可以为这极大的荣耀自夸，我们又会获得什么益处呢？我们将会从高位上被抛下了，在永恒中羞耻的站在上帝和他的众天使面前。最后，亲爱的救主啊，如果我们想要离开你去寻找这个世上的智慧，我们又会获得什么呢？离开那向我们显明了天国之路的光，今生一切的光将会把我们指到哪儿去呢？看啊，主啊，如果我们想要离开你，我们可以去哪儿呢？我们不知道。

However, my dear children, Peter answered Christ’s question, “Do you want to go away as well?” not only by saying, “Lord to whom shall we go?” but in the second place he also added, “You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that You are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69).

然而，亲爱的弟兄姐妹，彼得回答基督的问题“你们也要离开吗？”他不仅说：“我们还跟从谁呢？”接下来他说：“你有永生之道，我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。”

Peter wishes to say: Lord, we could not leave You because You have the words that have gone right through us as no man’s words have. You have breathed new life into our dead hearts. Your words not only stir and shake our hearts, but they also refresh, rejoice, and comfort us. Your words have not only shown us the way to eternal life, but they have also enlightened us with the light of eternal life itself. You have filled our souls with the foretaste of the power of the world to come. Your words have not only directed us from the world to heaven, but they have opened heaven and God’s own heart. You have made us certain that we have forgiveness of sins and a gracious God, that we are righteous before God and His children, that we have a share in the glory of heaven and are heirs of eternal life. We have experienced in our hearts that You are truly the Christ, the only Savior of the world, the Son of the living God. Now if we wanted to leave You, we would leave life and choose death, leave salvation and choose damnation, leave heaven and choose hell.

彼得想要说：主啊，我们不能离开你，因为你赐给我们的话是没人能赐给我们的。你将新生命吹入我们死亡的心里。你的话并不仅仅激起和震动我们的心，它们也更新、鼓舞并安慰我们。你的话不仅仅向我们显明永生的道路，它们也用永生的光照耀着我们。你的话不仅仅将我们从这个世界指向天堂，它们也为我们开启了天堂和上帝的心。你让我们确信，我们有了罪的赦免和一个恩慈的上帝，我们在上帝和他的儿女面前是公义的，我们分享了天国的荣耀，是永生的后裔。你让我们体验到，你真是基督，这个世界唯一的救主，永生神的儿子。现在，如果我们想要离开你，我们就会离开生命选择死亡，离开救恩选择咒诅，离开天堂选择地狱。

You, see my dear children, thus with shining eyes and passionate heart Peter answered the Savior’s question, “Do you want to go away as well?” Tell me, can you give a different answer? Must you not also declare and confess before this congregation that even you have often found that Christ’s words are not weak words of men, but the words of eternal life? Did not your souls often stir at the hearing of Christ’s words, something you never found in the hearing of men’s words? Have you not often experienced how God Himself mightily knocked on your hearts at the hearing of Christ’s words? Have you not often experienced how God’s Holy Spirit moved the foundation of your souls at the hearing of Christ’s words, how you began to pray for grace, how He mightily drew you to God, enlightened you concerning the condition of your souls, reprimanded you on account of your sins? Were you not often overwhelmed with comfort, hope, peace, and joy? Have you not experienced in your hearts that Christ’s words are God’s words, full of life and power, and that He Himself is the only Savior of sinners, the Son of the living God? Have you not often felt that you could have shouted to the whole world: Oh unbelievers, do not reject Christ and His Word; I can swear that He is truly God’s Son and the Savior of the world! I have experienced it!?

亲爱的弟兄姐妹，你们看，彼得带着明亮的目光和热切的心回答了救主的问题：“你们也要离开吗？”现在，告诉我，你们会给出一个不同的回答吗？难道你们不也曾在这个教会宣告并承认，即便是你们，也常常发现基督的话并不是人软弱无能的话，而是永生的道？你们的心在听到基督的道的时候，不也常常被搅动吗？这是你们在听人的话的时候从来未曾感受到的。你们不也常常在听到基督的道的时候，上帝亲自用他大能的手叩响你们的心门吗？你们不也常常在听到基督的道的时候，经历到上帝的圣灵如何震动你们的心，让你们开始去祈求他的恩典，他如何用他的大能吸引你来到他面前，开启你的心，启蒙你属灵的状态，为你的罪责备你？你们不也常常被安慰、盼望、平安和喜乐所淹没吗？你们的心难道未曾知道，基督的话是上帝的话，满有生命和能力，他自己是罪人独一的救主，永生上帝的儿子？你们不也常常感到，你们想要向全世界呼喊：哦，不信的人啊，不要拒绝基督和他的道；我可以发誓他真是上帝的儿子和这个世界的救主！

If the Savior would ask you today, “Do you want to go away as well?” need you reflect any longer as to what your answer will be? No, no, you will, you must, with shining eyes and passionate hearts, not only say as Peter did, “Lord, to whom shall we go?” you will, you must, also add: Lord, if we leave You, we would be like wanderers, who forsook their guide and went into the dark forest upon unbeaten paths only to perish helplessly. We would be like sheep, who forsook the shepherd and his pasture and went into the barren wilderness only to languish. We would be like sailors who forsook the lifeboat and jumped into the raging sea. No, no, we will remain with You, Lord Jesus. “You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that You are the Holy One of God.”

如果救主在今天问你：“你们也要离开吗？”你还需要一段时间去思考你的答案会是什么吗？不，你将会，你必定会，带着明亮的目光和热切的心，不仅和彼得一样说：“主啊，我们还能跟从谁呢？”你也将会也必定会加上：主啊，如果我们离开你，我们就会像流浪者一样，抛弃他们的向导，走进黑暗的密林，踏上蛮荒的道路，并只能陷入无助的灭亡。我们就会像迷失的羊，离开牧羊人和他的草场，进入贫瘠的旷野，任凭自己走向衰败。我们就会像水手抛弃了救生船，跳入狂暴的海洋里。不，不，我们要和你在一起，主耶稣啊。“在你有永生之道，我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。”

Oh my dear children, do not say that only today but whenever your corrupt heart, your flesh and blood, or the world want to entice you away from Christ and His words, whenever you are tempted to forsake Christ and strive after gold and earthly treasures or the friendship of the world, or join in the vain lusts and pleasures of the world, or seek honor and respect among men, or even join the sworn enemies of Christ and his Word. Ah, then recall that Christ stands before you again like He does today and says, “Do you also want to go away?”

哦，弟兄姐妹们，不要只在今天说，每当你堕落的心，你的肉体和情欲，或这个世界，想要引诱你离开基督和他的道，每当你被试探去抛弃基督，去追逐黄金和属世的财宝，或者这世界的友谊，或者参与这世界徒劳的情欲和宴乐中，或者寻求荣耀和人的尊重，或者甚至加入基督和他的道不共戴天的敌人中。那么回想基督再一次站在你面前，像他今天一样，说：“你也想要离开吗？”

Although all the world should forsake and forget Thee,

In love I will follow Thee, ne’er will I quit Thee.

Lord Jesus, both spirit and life is Thy Word;

And is there a joy which Thou dost not afford? (TLH 366:4

RITE OF CONFIRMATION—CONCLUDING TALK AND PRAYER

Thus my dear children, the great work has taken place. Your heavenly Bridegroom has sued for your souls, and you have given them to Him. You have given your consent; the covenant of faithfulness is forever concluded. He Himself was among us and heard your oath. He is now ready to embrace you. Remain with Him until the last breath of your life.

亲爱的弟兄姐妹，伟大的工作已经完成了。你们在天上的新郎为你们的灵魂求婚了，你们已经同意了；这忠实的约永远立定。上帝亲自在我们中间并听了你们的誓言。他现在准备好要拥抱你们。属于他直到在生命的最后一刻。

The hour of parting has now struck. We will never again be gathered together as we were in the past months and as we are today. In conclusion I therefore say to you from the bottom of my heart: Farewell, farewell, dear children! I hope to see most of you again in this house and at this altar of the Lord, if God prolongs our life. However, if all of you remain with Jesus, we will see each other in heaven before the throne of the Lamb; then all of you will be clothed in white, wear crowns on your heads, and carry harps in your hands. Then you will be truly confirmed. Then all temptations, all dangers, all works, all struggles will have ended. Then you will no longer cry, “Lord, have mercy on us!” but will join in the eternal hallelujah of all cherubim and seraphim, all angels and perfected saints. Oh, how you will rejoice that you were preserved until the end, that you remained faithful until death! Then you will bless this day and from eternity to eternity give praise and honor and thanksgiving and glory to the Lamb, who was slain and bought you with His blood and kept you unto salvation. Once more I say to you: Until then, my dear children, farewell, farewell!

最终，我们将在天堂羔羊的宝座前重逢；那时，你们所有人都将身穿白衣，头上戴着王冠，在你们手上拿着竖琴。那时给你们的一切应许将会真的应验。那时所有的试探、所有的危险、所有的工作所有的挣扎都将结束。那时你讲不会再呼喊：“主啊，开恩可怜我们！”而是和所有的天使天军，所有的圣徒一起，高唱哈利路亚，直到永远，哦，你将多么高兴，你被持守到末了，你依然存留信心直到死亡！那时你将祝福这一天，从永远到永远赞美、尊崇、感谢和荣耀那独一的被杀的羔羊，他用他的血买了你们，使你们得救。再一次我要对你说：我多么渴望那时我们的重逢啊！

Now you, my dear congregation, and especially you fathers, mothers, sponsors, brothers, sisters, friends, and relatives of these children, open your loving arms and receive these children from my hands, from the hands of their teachers. Receive them as your brothers and sisters. However, do not say as did Cain, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Genesis 4:9). Parents, bear in mind, you remain the parents of these children until your death; God will some day demand them from your hands.

You, however, who are not bound so closely to these children through the bonds of blood, bear in mind the word of Christ, “When you have turned again, strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32). If you are converted, strengthen these weak children; watch over them. If they are in danger, warn them. If they go astray, bring them back. If you see them fall, lift them up. If you will faithfully do this, you will also someday stand with these children— oh, may it be all of us—as we stand here with them in hope, before Christ’s throne seeing the things for which we hoped.

现在，你们，我亲爱的朋友，无论你们是父亲、母亲、配偶、兄弟、姐妹、朋友、亲人，张开你的臂膀接纳你身边的人，他们是上帝赐给你们的，接纳他们如同你们的兄弟和姐妹，不要像该隐一样说：“我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”你们和你们身边之人联系的如此紧密，不仅仅是借着血缘的纽带，你们要记住基督的话：“当你回头的时候，要坚固你的弟兄。”当你回头的时候，坚固那些软弱的人，看护他们。如果他们在危险中，警告他们，如果他们误入歧途，将他们带回来。如果你看到他们跌倒，扶持他们。当你忠实的做了这些事，你将会在某一天，和他们在盼望中，站在基督的宝座面前，看到我们所盼望的一切事，哦，愿我们所有人都站在那里。

Now that this may take place, let us kneel and in heartfelt devotion and firm faith carry the needs of these children to the Savior:

现在，让我们一起祷告，将我们自己和我们弟兄姐妹的需要交给救主：

Lord Jesus Christ, You have asked these children, “Do you want to go away as well?” and they have answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that You are the Holy One of God.” They have confessed that they know no other Savior, that they can find deliverance from sin, trouble, and death only in You, light only from You, grace only from You, righteousness only with You, comfort only with You, power only with You, life and salvation only with You. Therefore they want to remain with You until death.

主耶稣基督啊，你问我们说：“你也想要离开吗？”我们回答说：“主啊，你有永生之道，我们还跟从谁呢？我们已经信了，又知道你是上帝的圣者。”我们已经承认，我们不认识什么别的救主，我们只能在你里面找到罪、烦恼和死亡的解救，只能从你那里得到光明和恩典，只有与你同在的公义、安慰、能力、生命和拯救。因此我们想要和你在一起，直到死亡。

Oh Jesus, remain also with them and do not reject them. Yes, bind them fast to Your heart; for if You do not hold them, they cannot hold You. Even today their resolution and will is very weak; but You have promised to be their strength. They are unworthy sinners, but just for the sake of sinners You have come into the world as a Savior of sinners and not of the righteous. Their souls are sick and frail; but You are a Physician not of the healthy but of the weak and miserable. We well know that none of these children will be completely faithful to You. Forgetting their vows, they will often stumble and fall, but You have promised that You will remain faithful even if we become unfaithful. Finally, we well know that we are entirely unworthy of Your listening to our poor prayers for these children, but we do not lie here before You in our righteousness but in Your great mercy. We pray to You alone in trust upon Your command and promise. Oh, hear us then. These children are not our children; they are Yours. You have bought them with Your blood; if they should be lost, You will lose them.

哦，耶稣，请同样保守我们，不要拒绝我们。是的，把我们紧紧放在你的心上；因为如果你不抓住我们，我们就不能抓住你。即便到今天，我们的决心和意志都还何等软弱，但是你应许了作为我们的刚强。我们是不配的罪人，但是你正是为罪人的缘故，来到这个世界，成为罪人的救主，而不是义人的救主。我们的心灵孱弱而病态，但是你是医生，不是为健康的人而是为弱者和受苦者。我们都知道，我们中间没有一个人会完全地忠实于你。我们会忘记我们对你的承诺，我们会常常踌躇并跌倒，但是你应许了，即便是我们变得不忠实，你依然忠实于你对我们的承诺。最后，我们清楚的知道，我们完全不配得你听我们可怜的祷告，但是这儿，我们不是在我们的义中而是在你无限的怜悯中，匍倒在你面前，我们唯独倚靠你的吩咐和应许向你祈求。

Oh, therefore have mercy upon them. Keep them in Your truth and grace. When in temptation, be their protection. When in sin, be their throne of grace. When in trouble and temptation, their comfort. When in death, their life. When in judgment and damnation, their Savior and Intercessor.

哦，主啊，因此，请怜悯我们。保守我们在你的真理和恩典里。在试探中做我们的保护。在罪中作我们恩典的保障，在麻烦中做我们的安慰，在死亡中作我们的生命。在审判和定罪中，作我们的救主和代祷者。

Oh Jesus, we cannot keep them; we therefore place them in Your lap and in Your arms. They are eternally given into Your charge. Preserve them, help them in life and save them in death.

哦，耶稣，我们甚至不能保守我们自己，因此我们将我们放在你的膝上和你的臂膀里。我们将永远归你掌管。请保守我们，在生命中帮助我们，在死亡中搭救我们。

Oh Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world and also their sin, have mercy upon them!

哦，上帝的羔羊，除去世人也除去我们罪孽的，怜悯我们！

Oh Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world and also their sin, have mercy upon them!

哦，上帝的羔羊，除去世人也除去我们罪孽的，怜悯我们！

Oh Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world and also their sin, give them Your peace. Amen! Amen!

哦，上帝的羔羊，除去世人也除去我们罪孽的，赐平安给我们！

阿门阿门！
